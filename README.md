This is a quick language in development, the interpreter is being made with C, and C++.
It can run mathemathical operations, process variables and print. (0.1)

The first release for Sapphire was meant to be released in 23 June, 2025, but im changing the language ENTIRELY, implementing
a Virtual Machine for compiling, and using bytecode with JIT to convert the language data directly to computer language.

The estimated time with a 80k line program with a loop repeating the same mathematical operation will jump from 6.5s
to approx. 1s or less!
